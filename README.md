# Schoolbox Opener
This is a script to find our classes before they are released.
This will open random schoolbox class pages, then you can look through the tabs and see if any ones are your next years classes.

First you must run:

pip install random
pip install time
pip install webbrowser
pip install os

To use just run the python file
